# pg2ili
Python script to import tables from a PostgreSQL/PostGIS SQL file to [INTERLIS](https://www.interlis.ch/en).


If you start from a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database and want to obtain a model in INTERLIS from it, you can use this script to get all your PG tables written as INTERLIS classes. Then you can open the obtained ili file in [UML/INTERLIS Editor](https://github.com/AgenciaImplementacion/umleditor/) and adjust your model, i.e., add relationships, meta-attributes and the like. 

See the tests/ folder for examples.
